## How does an LLM like Deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct work?

A language model like Deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct operates based on the principles of a transformer architecture (like GPT). It learns from vast amounts of text data, including programming code, comments, and documentation. During training, it learns to generate meaningful code snippets, answer programming-related queries, or even debug code by predicting what comes next in a sequence based on patterns from its training data.

When you're using the model, you're interacting with it in a "prompt-response" manner. You give it a prompt (e.g., a coding question, a piece of code to complete, or a function to write), and the model generates the most likely continuation based on the patterns it learned during training

## What is the role of embeddings?

In the context of an LLM like Deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct, embeddings are numerical representations of words, sentences, or pieces of code. The model doesnâ€™t directly understand the words or code as humans do, so it converts them into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic relationships. For example:

- Code embeddings: If you ask the model to write a function, the model converts your prompt into a vector and then looks at the most likely vector representations for the code it generates.

- Semantic search: Embeddings allow the model to understand the meaning of words or code segments, not just their syntax. It can understand that "for loop" and "iteration over a range" refer to the same concept, even though they are written differently.

## Why use vector-based databases with embeddings?

Now, this is where vector-based databases (like FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate) come into play. These databases are designed to handle and search through high-dimensional vectors efficiently. When you use embeddings, you're essentially creating a vector space of information.

Here's why vector databases are helpful:

1. Semantic Search: When you store embeddings of code snippets or documentation in a vector-based database, you can perform searches based on meaning rather than exact keywords. For example, if you search for "calculate square root," the database can return similar pieces of code that solve that problem, even if the exact wording is different.

2. Efficient Retrieval: Searching through traditional databases for code or information can be slow and inefficient. A vector-based DB makes it possible to search for similar vectors in sub-linear time, enabling quick retrieval of relevant code or context from a large dataset.

3. Scalability: When you have a large codebase or a vast collection of documentation, storing embeddings and indexing them in a vector DB allows for fast, scalable searching and retrieval, even if your dataset grows exponentially.

4. Contextual Understanding: In programming, context matters a lot. The vector representation of your query (like a piece of code or a question) can be compared with vector representations of prior code or explanations, enabling the model to provide relevant suggestions based on context, not just the exact words.
